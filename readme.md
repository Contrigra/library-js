## Library-js

Small personal book tracker from The Odin Project

GitHub pages: https://contrigra.github.io/library-js/

The goal was to practice Javascript and objects, prototypes
 - Even if there aren't many prototypes made by myself, understanding the underlying concepts drastically improved my documentation comprehension.

### Things I practiced and learnt: 
- Usage of consts, let and arrow functions 
- Event handlers on things I never did
  - formdata, window.onload etc
- Card factory
- mapping DOM elements to Javascript elements
  - Each card is a representation of Book object in the library
- Addition of event listener inside of other functions
  - Helped me to avoid referencing elements not created yet
  - `!` operator came in handy 
- Manipulated classList from JS
- practiced grid and flex together
