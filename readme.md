## Library-js

Small personal book tracker from The Odin Project

GitHub pages: https://contrigra.github.io/library-js/

The goal was to practice Javascript and objects, prototypes

- Even if there aren't many prototypes made by myself, understanding the
  underlying concepts drastically improved my documentation comprehension.

### Things I practiced and learnt:

- Usage of consts, let and arrow functions
- Event handlers on things I never did
    - formdata, window.onload etc
- Card factory
- mapping DOM elements to Javascript elements
    - Each card is a representation of Book object in the library
- Addition of event listener inside of other functions
    - Helped me to avoid referencing elements not created yet
    - `!` operator came in handy
- Manipulated classList from JS
- practiced grid and flex together

## Update

- Added a branch with class based approach. Pretty simple refactoring, but
  practiced constructing and static methods
